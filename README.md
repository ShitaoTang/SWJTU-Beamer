## About the Color Standard

This template references the official  
[西南交通大学视觉识别系统（VIS）](https://news.swjtu.edu.cn/gywm/zlxz.htm).

- The official color **“交大蓝”** is defined as **C90 M40 Y5 K5**.  
- The RGB value was measured manually on Macbook using a digital colorimeter from the *“西南交通大学视觉识别系统（VIS）手册（矢量文件）” (2019.06.03)*.  
- Final RGB used in this template: **(51, 117, 174)**.  
  (This was chosen because the formula-converted RGB was not visually suitable for digital distribution.)
